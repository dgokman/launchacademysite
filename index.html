   	  <p>I am a 31 year old Ad Operations Manager who has worked in
mobile startups for the last 6 years. Working closely with developers
and engineers has made me very interested in what they do. As much of
my company is built with Ruby on Rails, I have become motivated to
learn it and found Launch Academy to be the best resource to achieve
this goal. Additionally, I have been taking classes at Harvard
Extension School that cover HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. I feel
that my years of professional experience, education, passion for
technology, and desire to build the applications of the future make
me a great candidate for this program. When I am not learning to
code, I love to read historical non-fiction, watch basketball, and
play poker.
